# Exploratory analysis of heavy traffic indicators on the I-94 interstate highway using data visualisation techniques.

Interstate 94 (I-94) is an eastâ€“west Interstate Highway connecting the Great Lakes and northern Great Plains regions of the United States.

This project aims to analyse the westbound traffic on the Interstate highway. Our primary goal is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on the highway through visualisation techniques using pandas and matplotlib.
